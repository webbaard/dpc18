In the first part of the workshop, we will gradually flesh out examples of how the system works using a technique known as Example Mapping. From these we\u2019ll collaboratively write executable specifications (scenarios) in Gherkin. Writing scenarios and developing a \u201cubiquitous\u201d language can be the most time consuming part of the process albeit the one in which most of the hard work is done.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the workshop will focus on driving the actual application code from the scenarios and automating them. We will use some parts of the Symfony framework for the app itself and a PHP tool called Behat for executing the scenarios. This part of the workshop will also introduce some aspects of strategic domain modelling. Most of the application will be automated at the \u201cdomain level\u201d, and given enough time, we will also automate at the UI and\/or browser level.",

Have you ever experienced side effects of upgrading third party components or server configuration changes? Do you have trouble testing your entire site to ensure bugs weren't introduced?\r\n\r\nIf so, you may need browser automation testing. In this tutorial we will combine Puppeteer, Mocha, and Chai to automate your browser and test all your site's components. This will lead you to deliver your updates reliably and catch bugs before they get deployed.",

Comparing offline storage mechanisms, and their limitations.\r\n\r\nThis talk is great for anyone building web-based applications, in any language, or anyone wanting to learn more about PWA's and offline development",
